## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep violet (#6941DE) to give the application a high-tech but professional feel. This also suggests safety and security, given the app's intended use.

- Accent color: Electric blue (#40E0D0) to highlight key interactive elements such as CTAs, without drawing attention away from content or implying 'danger'.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif font, for its modern, neutral and readable style, and for its suitability to both headlines and body text.
- Use modern, minimalist icons throughout the app to represent different anchor point types, test statuses, and reporting functions.
- Employ a clean, grid-based layout to ensure information is well-organized and easily accessible.
- Incorporate subtle transitions and animations to enhance user experience and provide feedback during interactions.
